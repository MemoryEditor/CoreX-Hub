# CoreX Hub
CoreX is outdated, feel free to "learn" from it but don't follow my bad practices and commands handler.

Aiming to make a script hub that can be used in lots of games.

To use CoreX, use the following script:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MemoryEditor/CoreX-Hub/main/source.lua")))()
```

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to CoreX.
